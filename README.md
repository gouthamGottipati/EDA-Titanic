# Titanic Dataset EDA

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this analysis can be downloaded from the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Download the `titanic.csv` file and place it in the same directory as the Python script.

## Requirements

To run the EDA, you will need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Analysis

1. Download the `titanic.csv` file from the Kaggle link provided.
2. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the `titanic_eda.py` script.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python titanic_eda.py
```

This will output visualizations and statistics about the Titanic dataset, including survival rates, passenger demographics, and more.

## Output

The script will generate several plots and visualizations, including:

- Missing Data Heatmap
- Survival Count
- Passenger Class Distribution
- Age Distribution
- Survival by Gender and Class
- Correlation Matrix

## Files

- `titanic_eda.py`: Python script for performing the EDA.
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset file (not included in this repository).
